# No 'Black Lives Matter' promotionals, please!

Tired of seeing Black Lives Matter 'informationals' obscuring technical information? This list is for you. 
 
I created this list to allow you to forcefully opt-out of Black Lives Matter promotional text on websites. If you just need to get work done, and don't concern yourself with politics / causes, this is for you.

I'm personally quite tired of BLM promotional text obscuring technical information on websites like the [RxJS documentation](https://rxjs.io). I'd just like to get my JavaScript development done in peace.
