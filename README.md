Tired of seeing Black Lives Matter 'informationals' obscuring technical information? This list is for you. 
 
I created this list to allow you to forcefully opt-out of Black Lives Matter promotional text on websites. If you just need to get work done, and don't concern yourself with politics / causes, this is for you.

I'm personally quite tired of BLM promotional text obscuring technical information on websites like the [RxJS documentation](https://rxjs.io). I'd just like to get my JavaScript development done in peace.

## Political

There are also political issues with the Black Lives Matter, which are best summarised by [this article in The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/28/does-black-lives-matter-care-black-lives-white-people-threatening/). This list of filters is designed to allow people to opt-out of this movement, especially when they disagree with it on a fundamental level.

## Obstructions

Quite a few developer-focused pages have ramped up their Black Lives Matter advertising, which has come to obstruct developers from getting to technical resources. This poses as an annoyance to people who *just want to get work done* at home, in the middle of a global pandemic, without being deep-throated by political movements.

## Contributions

**All contributions are welcome**. Submit a merge request if you'd like to add or site, or an issue if you'd like to remove an ineffective / false filter.

If your issue with this repository is purely of political substance, please take it elsewhere. I'll immediately close issues which 'disagree' with this, since they're irrelevant to the project. I will not take harrassment as a result of creating this repository, and any violators of this will be reported to GitHub with swiftness and precision.
